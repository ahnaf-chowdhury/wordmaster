# wordmaster
My implementation of a wordle-like game that lets you guess a five-letter word in six tries. It uses words from the repository [five-letter-words](https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words). Python version used: 3.8.

## Requirements

The only external libraries used are enchant and requests. Requirements can be installed using the requirements file as shown below,

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or by installing enchant(pyenchant) and requests manually.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local drive or just download the 'wordmaster.py' file, and run the file.

```bash
python wordmaster.py
```
